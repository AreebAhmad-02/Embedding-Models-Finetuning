This exclusive payroll-based tax discourages job creation and economic growth,\\nlowers wages, and provides an unstable revenue stream.\\n2. San Francisco currently charges a flat rate on its payroll expense tax base. Instituting a\\ntiered rate structure, in which businesses are taxed based on their gross receipts, will better distribute\\nthe tax burden according to a business's ability to pay.\\n3. Gross receipts is the most common business tax base among California's largest cities\\n4. Amending San Francisco's business tax system to include a gross receipts tax will promote\\nrevenue stability by diversifying the tax base.\\n5. The rate schedules and the small business exemption for businesses with receipts under\\n$1,000,000 provide particular tax relief to small businesses.\\n33SAN\\nFIEW\\n2024 MAY 10 BJ: 29\\n6.\", '3dce85f1-63d5-41db-be2e-650fc9872224': 'TAX CREDIT FOR SUPERMARKETS AND OTHER GROCERY RETAILERS.\\n(a) For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, a person or combined group shall be\\nallowed a credit against that person or combined group\\'s Gross Receipts Tax equal to 0.5% of such\\nperson or combined group\\'s taxable gross receipts from business activities described in\\nNAICS Code 445110 (Supermarkets and Other Grocery Retailers (except Convenience Retailers)), up to\\na maximum annual credit of $4,000,000.\\n(b) For purposes of this Section 960.3, \"taxable gross receipts\" means a person or combined\\ngroup\\'s gross receipts, not excluded under Section 954 of this Article 12-A-1, attributable to the City.\\n(c) In no event shall the credit under this Section 960.3 reduce a person or combined group\\'s\\nGross Receipts Tax liability to less than $0 for any tax year.
