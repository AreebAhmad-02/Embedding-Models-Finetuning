San Francisco currently charges a flat rate on its payroll expense tax base. Instituting a\ntiered rate structure, in which businesses are taxed based on their gross receipts, will better distribute\nthe tax burden according to a business's ability to pay.\n3. Gross receipts is the most common business tax base among California's largest cities\n4. Amending San Francisco's business tax system to include a gross receipts tax will promote\nrevenue stability by diversifying the tax base.\n5. The rate schedules and the small business exemption for businesses with receipts under\n$1,000,000 provide particular tax relief to small businesses.\n33SAN\nFIEW\n2024 MAY 10 BJ: 29\n6.",
