San Francisco voters approved the first\nsuch sales tax and expenditure plan in November 1989 as Proposition B and the\nsecond in November 2003 as Proposition K. The San Francisco County\nTransportation Authority (Transportation Authority) was established through the\n1989 ballot measure to administer the sales tax and subsequently was\ndesignated as administrator of the 2003 successor measure.",

More details on administration are included in Section 5,\nImplementation Provisions.\nBy providing the required local match, the 2022 Sales Tax is intended to\nleverage about $23.7 billion in federal, state, regional, and other local funding for\ntransportation projects in San Francisco.\nThe 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan contains a list of transportation\nprograms describing the types of transportation investments that will be given\npriority for 2022 Sales Tax funding.",

The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan also does not limit\nthe discretion of agencies proposing to carry out eligible projects to select a \"no\naction\" or a \"no project\" alternative.\n2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan Summary Table. Table 1 below summarizes\nthe proposed 2022 Sales Tax revenue allocations by category, subcategory, and\nprogram in constant 2020 dollars. There are five categories, identified with capital\nletters (A through E). The first subdivision level under each category is known as a\nsubcategory. Subcategories are indicated with lower case Roman numerals. The level\nbelow a subcategory is known as a program. Programs are indicated with numbers.\nThe 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan identifies eligible expenditures through a set\nof programs that guides the types of transportation projects that will be funded by the\n2022 Sales Tax. The programs are set up to address allocation of funds to multi-year\nprograms for a given purpose, such as street resurfacing or street safety\nimprovements, for which not all specific project locations or improvements can be\nanticipated or identified at the time of adoption of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure\nPlan. This approach provides certainty about the types of investments that will be\nmade balanced with the flexibility needed for a 30-year plan.",
