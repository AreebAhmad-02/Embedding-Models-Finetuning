DEPARTMENT OF ELECTIONS
A gross receipts tax that is a percentage of a business's San Francisco gross receipts.
Depending on business type, the City determines a business's San Francisco gross
receipts based on sales in San Francisco, payroll expenses for employees working there,
or both. Rates range from 0.053% to 1.008% and are scheduled to increase in coming
years. Rates depend on business type, and higher rates apply as a business generates
more gross receipts. For 2023, most businesses with gross receipts up to $2.19 million
are exempt.
A homelessness gross receipts tax that is an additional tax on businesses with San
Francisco gross receipts over $50 million. Rates range from 0.175% to 0.69%.
An overpaid executive gross receipts tax that is an additional tax on businesses that pay
their highest-paid managerial employee much higher than the median compensation they
pay their San Francisco employees. Rates are between 0.1% and 0.6%.
A business registration fee that is an additional tax. For most businesses the fee is
currently between $47 and $45,150, based on business type and amount of gross receipts.
• An administrative office tax on payroll expenses that certain large businesses pay instead
of these other business taxes. The combined rates in 2024 range from 3.04% to 5.44%,
and in 2025 are scheduled to range from 3.11% to 5.51%. Business registration fees for
these businesses currently range from $19,682 to $45,928.
State law limits the total revenue, including tax revenue, the City may spend each year. The
voters may approve increases to this limit for up to four years.
The Proposal
The proposed measure would change the City's business taxes to:
•
For the gross receipts tax:
○ recategorize business types, reducing the number from 14 to seven;
determine San Francisco gross receipts for some businesses based less on payroll
expenses and more on sales;
o change rates to between 0.1% and 3.716%; and
exempt most businesses with gross receipts up to $5 million (increased by
inflation).
Apply the homelessness gross receipts tax on business activities with San Francisco gross
receipts over $25 million, at rates between 0.162% and 1.64%.
Modify how the City calculates the overpaid executive gross receipts tax and who pays
that tax, and set rates between 0.02% and 0.129%.
Adjust business registration fees to between $55 and $60,000 (increased by inflation).Adjust the administrative office tax rates for certain large businesses to range from 2.97%
to 3.694%, and the business registration fees for these taxpayers to between $500 and
$35,000 (increased by inflation).
Make administrative and other changes to the City's business taxes.
The homelessness gross receipts tax would continue to fund services for people experiencing
homelessness and homelessness prevention. The City would use the other taxes for general
government purposes.
All these taxes would apply indefinitely until repealed.
This proposal would increase the City's spending limit for four years.SALITA CO

GS AND
SEC. 950. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
The voters hereby find and declare as follows:
1. San Francisco is the only major city in California that levies its entire business tax on
payroll expense. This exclusive payroll-based tax discourages job creation and economic growth,
lowers wages, and provides an unstable revenue stream.
2. San Francisco currently charges a flat rate on its payroll expense tax base. Instituting a
tiered rate structure, in which businesses are taxed based on their gross receipts, will better distribute
the tax burden according to a business's ability to pay.
3. Gross receipts is the most common business tax base among California's largest cities
4. Amending San Francisco's business tax system to include a gross receipts tax will promote
revenue stability by diversifying the tax base.
5. The rate schedules and the small business exemption for businesses with receipts under
$1,000,000 provide particular tax relief to small businesses.

6. The legislation will gradually phase in the new gross receipts tax over a five-year period,
DEPARTA
beginning in tax year 2014, to allow businesses time to adjust to the change and to minimize the risk to
the City and to taxpayers of instability in City revenues during the transition from the payroll expense
tax to a gross receipts tax.
7. Also beginning in tax year 2014, the payroll expense tax will be adjusted, over the same
period, in increments that are consistent with the phase in of the gross receipts tax.
8. Each year during the phase in period, the formula dictates an increase in the gross receipts
tax rate and an adjustment in the payroll expense tax rate that is expected to reduce the payroll expense
tax rate to zero by or before 2018. The Controller will calculate the annual increase in the gross
receipts tax rate and the adjustment in the payroll expense tax rate by applying formulas specified in
this legislation.

the portion of such compensation which the volume of business transacted by such individual in the
City bears to the volume of business transacted by such individual within and without the City.
