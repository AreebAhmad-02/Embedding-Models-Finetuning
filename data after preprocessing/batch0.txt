bonds at the Authority's discretion.

Introduction
A.
2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan
Summary. The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan identifies transportation
improvements to be funded from the retail transactions and use tax ("sales tax")
authorized under Public Utilities Code Section 131000 et seq. and passed by
San Francisco voters at the November 2022 election as Proposition _ ("2022
Sales Tax"). The programs included in the 2022 Transportation Expenditure
Plan are designed to be implemented over the next 30 years. The 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan includes investments in five major categories:
Major Transit Projects to support more reliable buses and trains and core

capacity improvements; Transit Maintenance and Enhancements to help keep
transit running safely and make connectivity, accessibility, and reliability
improvements; Paratransit services for seniors and people with disabilities;
Streets and Freeways to deliver safer, smoother streets including bicycle and
pedestrian improvements and street resurfacing; and Transportation System
Development and Management to fund programs that reduce congestion and
improve air quality and transportation/land use coordination.
Since 1990, San Francisco has had a one-half of one percent transactions and
use tax authorized under Public Utilities Code Section 131000 et seq. dedicated
to funding transportation improvements. San Francisco voters approved the first
such sales tax and expenditure plan in November 1989 as Proposition B and the
second in November 2003 as Proposition K. The San Francisco County
Transportation Authority (Transportation Authority) was established through the
1989 ballot measure to administer the sales tax and subsequently was
designated as administrator of the 2003 successor measure.
The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan for the use of funds from the 2022
Sales Tax was developed by the Expenditure Plan Advisory Committee (EPAC),
established by the Transportation Authority Board, with technical assistance
provided by the Transportation Authority and other transportation agencies. The
roster of EPAC members is provided in Attachment 1. The 2022 Transportation
Expenditure Plan was recommended by the Transportation Authority Board on
March 22, 2022.
Guided by the EPAC, equity has been at the forefront of the process to develop
the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan, the investments included within, as
well as how it will be administered.

Half of the EPAC is comprised of representatives from Equity Priority
Communities (EPCs) and other city neighborhoods, including organizations that
serve EPCs. The process to develop the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan
included robust outreach and engagement in multiple languages, with a focus on
reaching EPCs and populations that do not typically engage in transportation
planning.
Investments are designed to fill gaps identified in an equity analysis conducted
at the beginning of the process and include improvements to travel time and
accessibility, traffic safety, and public health, as well as addressing
transportation costs and supporting community-based planning, including a
focus on EPCs.
Administration of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan will include a
transparent and accountable process, and equity requirements have been built
into administration. More details on administration are included in Section 5,
Implementation Provisions.
By providing the required local match, the 2022 Sales Tax is intended to
leverage about $23.7 billion in federal, state, regional, and other local funding for
transportation projects in San Francisco.
The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan contains a list of transportation
programs describing the types of transportation investments that will be given
priority for 2022 Sales Tax funding. As such, the 2022 Transportation
Expenditure Plan shall be amended into the Capital Improvement Program of
the Congestion Management Program, developed pursuant to Section 65089 of
the California Government Code. These programs are intended to help
implement the long-range vision for the development and improvement of San

Francisco's transportation system, as articulated in the San Francisco
Transportation Plan (SFTP) 2050.
The SFTP is the City's blueprint to guide the development of transportation
funding priorities and policy. The SFTP is a living document, updated on a
quadrennial basis to identify and address changing needs and regional trends
and align them with available funding.
Goals. The purpose of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan is to
implement the priorities of the SFTP 2050 through investment in projects and
programs that include planning, maintenance, rehabilitation of, and
improvements to the city's multi-modal transportation system. The SFTP 2050
is part of the ConnectSF initiative, a multi-agency collaborative process to build
an effective, equitable, and sustainable transportation system for San
Francisco's future. The goals of ConnectSF and of the SFTP 2050 are:
Equity. San Francisco is an inclusive, diverse, and equitable city that
offers high-quality, affordable access to desired goods, services,
activities, and destinations.
Economic Vitality. To support a thriving economy, people and
businesses easily access key destinations for jobs and commerce in
established and growing neighborhoods both within San Francisco and
the region.
Environmental Sustainability. The transportation and land use system
support a healthy, resilient environment and sustainable choices for
future generations.

Safety and Livability. People have attractive and safe travel options
that improve public health, support livable neighborhoods, and address
the needs of all users.
Accountability and Engagement. San Francisco agencies, the broader
community, and elected officials work together to understand the City's
transportation needs and deliver projects, programs, and services in a
clear, concise, and timely fashion.

Adoption of an ordinance to impose a sales tax at the existing half-
cent rate for the 30-year implementation period of the 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan is necessary in order to fund the
transportation programs listed in Section 3, Table 1 and further
detailed in Section 4, Description of Programs.
It is deemed unnecessary to seek the support of adjacent counties
by requesting them to develop their own Transportation
Expenditure Plans because San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa,
Marin, and Santa Clara counties have already adopted
Transportation Expenditure Plans.
The Transportation Authority recommends that the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors place the aforementioned sales tax ordinance on the
November 2022 ballot.
The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan is organized into five sections.
Section 1: Introduction provides background on the Plan's goals and
development. Section 2: General Provisions provides further context on
the Plan's policies and administration. Section 3: 2022 Transportation

Expenditure Plan Summary Table summarizes the Plan's investment
detail (i.e., recommended funding distribution) by category, sub-category,
and program. Section 4: Description of Programs contains descriptions
of the programs (organized by category and subcategory), including the
types of projects that are eligible for funding under each of them.
Section 5: Implementation Provisions describes the process for
prioritizing and allocating funds from the 2022 Sales Tax following
adoption of the Plan.
General Provisions
A.
Sales Tax Revenues. The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan shall
supersede the Proposition K Expenditure Plan, adopted in 2003, as of the
operative date of the 2022 Sales Tax, which shall be at the same one-half
percent rate as approved by San Francisco voters in November 2003 as
Proposition K, and shall be imposed for the 30-year duration of the 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan.
Revenues from the 2022 Sales Tax are estimated under two scenarios over the
30-year period of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan, both of which are
net of an estimated $550 million in Proposition K financial liabilities (See
Section D, Successor Program). The conservative projection, which
corresponds to Priority 1 funding levels, puts the total revenue level at $2.378
billion (2020 dollars). This scenario reflects an average growth rate of 2.1%,
and an inflation-based discount rate of 3%. The more optimistic revenue
projection, which corresponds to Priority 2 funding levels, reflects an average
growth rate of 2.6%, and an inflation-based discount of 3%.

Fiscal Constraint. The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan is fiscally
constrained to the total funding expected to be available for each category (i.e.,
percent of revenues designated for each category) and by the funding caps
established for each program. The financial constraint is further detailed within
each program through the specification of funding priority levels, i.e., Priority 1
and Priority 2 (See Section 4 Description of Programs).
Restriction of Funds. 2022 Sales Tax revenues shall be spent on capital
projects rather than to fund operations and maintenance of existing
transportation services, unless otherwise explicitly specified in the Section 4,
Description of Programs. In accordance with enabling legislation and adopted
principles, 2022 Sales Tax revenues generated pursuant to this plan shall be
subject to the following restrictions:

Proceeds from the sale or liquidation of capital assets funded with
2022 Sales Tax revenues shall be returned to the Transportation
Authority (in proportion to the contribution of 2022 Sales Tax
revenues to the total original cost of the asset), for re-allocation to
eligible expenses within the program from which funds were
expended for the original investment.
No Expenditures Outside San Francisco. Unless otherwise explicitly
specified in Section 4, Description of Programs, no 2022 Sales Tax funds

Quantifiable Benefit. The proposed project is eligible to be
funded with the 2022 Sales Tax consistent with the 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan, and if planning or other studies
developed in order to enable its implementation demonstrate that
there will be a quantifiable benefit to the City and County's
transportation program from the expenditure of funds beyond the
City and County line. A quantifiable benefit is defined as a
measurable increase in the cost-effectiveness of a project or group
of transportation projects or services at least partially funded with
2022 Sales Tax funds, located along the corridor or in the
immediate geographic area of the City and County where the
project in question is proposed to occur.
Expenses Matched by Other Counties. The proposed expense
is matched by funding from the county where the expenditure of
2022 Sales Tax funds is proposed to be made.
Should transportation projects or services contemplated in the plan
require the participation of multiple counties for any phase of project
planning or implementation, the Transportation Authority shall work
cooperatively with the affected county or counties to ensure successful
project implementation.
Funding Caps for Legacy Projects. Projects carried forward from the
Proposition K Expenditure Plan as legacy projects shall be eligible to
receive Priority 1 funds from the designated programs, not to exceed the

Administration Costs. Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section
131107, not more than one percent of the annual net amount of revenues
raised by the 2022 Sales Tax may be used to administer the 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan.
Successor Program. The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan shall
supersede the Proposition K Expenditure Plan, adopted in 2003, as of the
operative date of the 2022 Sales Tax. As such it will bear responsibility for any
outstanding debt incurred by the Proposition K program, for reimbursement of
eligible costs for outstanding balances on Proposition K grants, and for other
financial liabilities arising from the Proposition K program. All assets of the
Proposition K program shall become Proposition _ program assets.
Bonding Authority. The Transportation Authority shall be authorized to issue,
from time to time, limited tax bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $1.91 billion, payable from the sales tax revenues generated pursuant to
the 2022 Sales Tax. The Transportation Authority's bonding capacity shall be
separate and distinct from that of the City and County of San Francisco.
Administration by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority.
The San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which currently allocates,
administers, and oversees the expenditure of the existing Proposition K sales
tax for transportation, shall allocate, administer, and oversee the expenditure of
the Proposition _ sales tax funds.

and/or the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and other applicable
laws shall be carried out as a prerequisite to the approval and implementation of
any project, including legacy projects, to be funded partially or entirely with 2022
Sales Tax funds. No definite commitment to any activity or project is made by
the adoption of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan. The 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan establishes a funding mechanism for
transportation improvements which does not involve any commitment to any
specific project which may result in a potentially significant physical impact on
the environment. The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan also does not limit
the discretion of agencies proposing to carry out eligible projects to select a "no
action" or a "no project" alternative.
2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan Summary Table. Table 1 below summarizes
the proposed 2022 Sales Tax revenue allocations by category, subcategory, and
program in constant 2020 dollars. There are five categories, identified with capital
letters (A through E). The first subdivision level under each category is known as a
subcategory. Subcategories are indicated with lower case Roman numerals. The level
below a subcategory is known as a program. Programs are indicated with numbers.
The 2022 Transportation Expenditure Plan identifies eligible expenditures through a set
of programs that guides the types of transportation projects that will be funded by the
2022 Sales Tax. The programs are set up to address allocation of funds to multi-year
programs for a given purpose, such as street resurfacing or street safety
improvements, for which not all specific project locations or improvements can be
anticipated or identified at the time of adoption of the 2022 Transportation Expenditure
Plan. This approach provides certainty about the types of investments that will be
made balanced with the flexibility needed for a 30-year plan.

1Total Expected Funding represents project costs or implementable phases of multi-phase
projects and programs based on a 30-year forecast of expected revenues from existing
federal, state, regional, and local sources, plus $2.598 billion in Proposition _ revenues. The
amounts in this column are provided in fulfillment of Sections 131051(a)(1), (b) and (c) of the
Public Utilities Code.
2The "Total Prop_" fulfills the requirements in Section 131051(d) of the Public Utilities Code.
³Percentages are based on Proposition _ Priority 1 and 2 forecasts of $2.598 billion. The
forecast is net of existing obligations of the predecessor Proposition K program.
4With very limited exceptions, the funds included in the 30-year forecast of expected revenues
are for capital projects rather than operations. Paratransit is the primary exception, providing
door-to-door vans and others transportation services for seniors and persons with disabilities
who cannot use regular fixed route transit. Total Expected Funding for Paratransit reflects
Proposition revenues, federal Section 5307 funds, and other sources of operating funds
included in SFMTA's annual operating budget over the next 30 years.

(5YPPs) (see Section 5.B). The Transportation Authority
Board shall adopt the Strategic Plan and updates thereof at
least every 5 years.
Prioritization Process. Prior to allocation of any revenues
from the 2022 Sales Tax, the Transportation Authority shall
prepare, in close consultation with all other affected
planning and implementation agencies, a 5YPP including
budget, scope, and schedule consistent with the Strategic
Plan, for review and adoption by the Transportation
Authority Board. For programs with only one eligible
sponsoring agency, the Transportation Authority may
designate that agency as the agency that is to prepare the
5YPP. The proposed projects shall be consistent with the
SFTP and with the City's General Plan.

explore alternative and non-traditional methods for project
and service delivery where they offer opportunities for
increased cost-effectiveness and/or shortened project
delivery timelines.
As part of the Strategic Plan development process, the
Transportation Authority shall adopt, issue, and update
detailed guidelines for the development of 5YPPS.
Project Delivery Oversight. The Transportation Authority Board
shall adopt project delivery oversight guidelines for major capital

shall include supporting the cost-effective and timely delivery of
projects funded wholly or in part by the 2022 Sales Tax.
Transportation Authority staff shall prepare a report at least
annually to the Transportation Authority Board to communicate the
status of these projects.
D. Funding Priority Levels. Each 2022 Transportation Expenditure
Plan program shall be funded using 2022 Sales Tax revenues up
to the total amount designated for that program in Priority 1. If,
after programming all Priority 1 funds to every program in a
subcategory, the latest Strategic Plan forecasts available revenues
from the 2022 Sales Tax in excess of Priority 1 levels, the
Transportation Authority Board may allow programming of Priority
2 funds within the subcategory, subject to the program dollar
amount caps for Priority 2 established in the 2022 Transportation
Expenditure Plan. If, after programming at least 80% of Priority 2
funds, the latest Strategic Plan forecasts available revenues from
the 2022 Sales Tax in excess of Priority 2 levels, the
Transportation Authority Board may allow programming of
revenues in excess of Priority 2 levels to programs in the 2022
Transportation Expenditure Plan as long as the percent of 2022.
Sales Tax revenues designated for each category is maintained in
compliance with the prioritization provisions set forth in
Sections 2.B, 5.B, and 5.D.

E. Cost Savings and Remaining Funds. If the eligible sponsoring
agency or agencies complete delivery of a 2022 Transportation
Expenditure Plan program or legacy project or determine that they
will no longer pursue implementation of the program or legacy
project with 2022 Sales Tax funds, the Transportation Authority
Board may use any remaining 2022 Sales Tax funds in that
program to fund one or more programs in the same category that
would otherwise be in compliance with the prioritization provisions
set forth in Sections 2.B, 5.B, and 5.D. To do so, the
Transportation Authority Board must first hold a public hearing on
the matter and then not sooner than 30 days after the hearing, the
Transportation Authority Board may, by a 2/3 vote, direct all or a
portion of the remaining funds to one or more 2022 Transportation
Expenditure Plan programs with the same category.
